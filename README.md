# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game

Rock–paper–scissors

Paper–scissors-rock (also known as scissors-rock-paper or other variants) is a hand game usually played between two people,
in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.

#Game Play
The players usually count aloud to three, or speak the name of the game (e.g. "Rock! Paper! Scissors!" or "Ro Sham Bo!"),
each time either raising one hand in a fist and swinging it down on the count or holding it behind. They then "throw" by 
extending it towards their opponent. Variations include a version where players use only three counts before throwing 
their gesture (thus throwing on the count of "Scissors!" or "Bo!"), or a version where they shake their hands three times
before "throwing".

I used use JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create a Rock Paper Scissors Game in the browser.
